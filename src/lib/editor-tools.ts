 * default and replaces any unregistered block type with a stub reading "The
 * block can not be displayed correctly" — a quiet degrade, not an error — so
 * a viewer with fewer tools than the editor stubs its own content.
 *
 * Every tool here supports `readOnly: true`, which Editor.js requires of all
 * of them: @see https://editorjs.io/configuration/
 *
 * Imported dynamically to keep ~135 KB of tools out of the initial bundle on
 * the public `/blog/[slug]` route, behind the same lazy load as Editor.js
 * itself. (Not for SSR safety — they guard their `document` access.)
